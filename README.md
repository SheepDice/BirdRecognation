# BirdRecognation

## Disclaimer
Rhis project is a copy of a training project made for a datascientist training led by Datascientest (datascintest.com)
The project as been realised by four students (Gregory PECHIN, Maxence REMI-HAROCHE, Yoni EDERY and myself, Armand BENOIT)
My current goal is to clean this project by deleting useless files, correcting codes and improving streamlit.

## Project
This project is inspired by a dataset provided on kaggle.com. You can download the dataset at the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species/discussion

The project aims to reconize bird species from 525 species (approximately).
It's a study project, so we explorer different ways, even if we allready kown it was not the best.
For instance, we worked on a ML model, based on color repartition (RGB) of images to determine the species of the bird.
It was obvisous that results would not be good, but it was interesting to apply the course, and try to get the best model
even in the worst condition.
Finally, after several tests with model from scratch and transfert learning, we figured out the best model use
EfficientNetB2.

The rest of the project will be dedicated to writing report (in french) and propose a light production implementation
with Streamlit.
